<h2>Avoid The Cones!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game is based on my Analog Assignment 4 which can be found on Bb. I made some custom assets such as the road, curb, and lane markings. 
While I did find the car image online, I had to turn it into a spritesheet which is my original work. 
I also made use of my original algorithm for recycling elements in the game for efficiency.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I was able to incorporate many assets, play multiple sounds at different volumes, and make a fully functionning and animated sprite. 
I have different sounds play for different events, in varying volumes. I incorporated some concepts from the textbook such as game feel, 
where I have the car's hitbox become smaller when making turns, to avoid frustration and to make the player feel proud of avoiding a cone 
that would have otherwise hit them. The game looks nice, and feels nice, and I think I deserve some credit for that.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This is my first time converting an analog game into a digital one, and I learned many techniques that are bound to make the next sequence 
easier. I also already have some ideas planned for the next iteration of this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Most of the graphical assets were handmade except for the cones. The car spritesheet was my work, but is based on the car image linked below.
