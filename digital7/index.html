<h2>Avoid The Cones!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game is an iteration of the previous assignment. I made some custom assets such as the road, curb, and lane markings. 
While I did find the car image online, I had to turn it into a spritesheet which is my original work. 
I also made use of my original algorithm for recycling elements in the game for efficiency. The idea of the game is fairly unique 
as I don't recall ever playing a game where I dodge cones forever.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
In addition to what I was able to accomplish for the past iteration of this game, I believe the changes I made show good progress.
I added more lanes to the game, and an intro scene that also serves to give players a break when they lose. I also added trees which 
is a purely cosmetic change. I changed the way the speed scales per level as it was a little too much, and have the number of cones increase 
with each level. Furthermore, I added a "Score" text on the top right corner of the screen to show the player the progress they are making.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This is the first prototype where I make use of more than one scene in the game. I can now incorporate any number of scenes into my games 
without any trouble.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Most of the graphical assets were handmade except for the cones and trees. The car spritesheet was my work, but is based on the car image linked below.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is based on the Analog Assignment 4, and is an iteration of Digital Assignment 6.

Avoid all cones.. until you can't.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
There was no mandatory theme for this assignment.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard input; both random and predetermined elements; competitor; adventure; overhead; infinite.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Avoiding obstacles in limtied area.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should have fun playing the game, they might get a little nervous when they reach higher levels in the game but should always enjoy playing it.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Use your keyboard's right and left arrow keys to steer the car away from the cones. The more you advance, the faster you will go, 
and the harder it becomes to avoid the ever increasing cones.
</li>

No Strategies work here, skills and reflexes are all that matters.
