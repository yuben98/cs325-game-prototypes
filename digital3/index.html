<h2>Pirate King</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game is fully original, I didn't rely on any prototype and wrote everything from scratch. It also includes custom assets
 such as hyper realistic waves and water. I also had to manually make the spritesheet for the main ship's animation as 
 the asset I borrowed for that had the images in separate files. The way some elements are recycled such as enemy ships 
 and waves is also something I wrote on my own. The way the game's difficulty scales by level is also an original idea of mine.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I was able to incorporate many assets, play multiple sounds at different volumes, and make a functionning spritesheet. 
Although recycling elements was something I managed to do in the past digital assignment, I had to modify the algorithm as
it now changes the elements' velocity, both vertical and horizontal, as well as their size. I also change the player's 
hitbox, making it smaller when turning. Difficulty scaling and balancing is also something I had to spend time working on, 
ensuring that the game isn't too difficult or too easy depending on the stage of the game the player is in.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This is the first prorotype where I worked with a spritesheet and animated it. It was time consuming to assemble the 
different images into one spritesheet and ensure that all the frames were the same size. It also took time to balance 
out the enemy ships' movement and velocity.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made a couple assets and borrowed some, I modified the ship assets.
<ul>
<li>Ship: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/black-sail-ship-bleeds-game-art">Ship</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Enemy pirate ships: <a href="https://www.kindpng.com/picc/m/302-3021888_transparent-pirate-ship-png-png-download.png">Pirate ships</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ship/sea sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/writeyournamehere/sounds/486871/">ship sound</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Music: <a href="https://filmmusic.io/song/7540-seven-seas">Music</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
None, I made it from scratch.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Become the Pirate King by avoiding all incoming enemy ships.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Pirate.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Direct mouse input; both random and predetermined elements; storyteller and competitor playstyles; adventure and overhead genres.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Side movement, avoiding obstacles.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to feel hooked to the game, attempting to beat their previous record time and time again.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players use their mouse pointer to lead the pirate ship away from the enemy ships. They can only move left and right, 
and move faster as they progress through levels. Enemy ships' velocity also increases with the levels, making it more 
difficult to avoid them.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players might try sticking to one side of the map when playing, but there isn't much strategy involved when trying to 
avoid randomly placed elements. Good refelexes are all that's needed.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A Pirate wants to find a treasure and become Pirate King, the other pirates won't let him.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
[0, infinity)
</li>
