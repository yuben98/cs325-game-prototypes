<h2>ZOMBIE SURVIVAL</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game is based on my Analog Assignment 5 and  Digital Assignment 8 which can be found on Bb and on this website respectvely. 
All the assets were custom made by myself, except for the sound effects and the grave/snowflake. I fully made the player and zombie 
sprites from scratch which took me longer than I would've liked. I added many new original elements to the game in this iteration 
that I'm sure will be enjoyable. The zombies spawn from all corners of the map, they leave bodies, and there is a freeze collectible 
powerup that freezes zombies in place and allows player to move to safety.</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I was able to incorporate many assets, play multiple sounds at different volumes, and make fully functionning and animated sprites. 
I have different sounds play for different events, in varying volumes. I incorporated some concepts from the textbook such as game feel.
I had to work with many new elements: Instead of creating a new bullet every time the player shoots, which causes huge 
performance issues the longer the game goes on, I recycle the same bullet but have it stay invisible until needed. I also have a very basic AI 
for the zombies that follow and attack the player.
<br>I fixed some issues with the zombies' animations so they now work as intended. I also modified the depth of some elements, and made use of 
more sound effects. I also added an intro scene to the game that also serves as a pause between each gameplay iteration the player makes. I also 
modified the gunshot sound to be faster, as I made use of it to limit the gunshots the player can make.
<br>Furthermore, I modify the angle with which the zombie's dead body spawns depending on its relative location to the player, which serves both 
to add variety to the bodies being spawned as well as realism.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This is my last iteration for this sequence and also for the class. I believe the improvements I've made to this version are very noticeable 
well implemented, and I enjoyed working with the multiple scenes and varying elements. I think this is my most complete game yet, and it's a 
nice way to end the semester.
